;; (a) define (sugared form) (define (name parameters) expressions)
;; This form is equivalent to (define name (lambda (parameters) expressions)).
;; (b) let (let bindings body)
;; Binds the given bindings for the duration of the body. The bindings is a list of (name
;; value) pairs. The body consists of one or more expressions which are evaluated in order
;; and the value of last is returned



;; 1. Guess the value, then evaluate the expression in scheme. If your guess differs from the actual
;; output, try desugaring any relevant expressions.
