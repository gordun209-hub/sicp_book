;; Consider the problem of representing line
;; segments in a plane. Each segment is represented as a pair
;; of points: a starting point and an ending point. Define a
;; constructor make-segment and selectors start-segment and
;; end-segment that define the representation of segments in
;; terms of points. Furthermore, a point can be represented
;; as a pair of numbers: the x coordinate and the y coordi-
;; nate. Accordingly, specify a constructor make-point and
;; selectors x-point and y-point that define this representa-
;; tion. Finally, using your selectors and constructors, define a
;; procedure midpoint-segment that takes a line segment as
;; argument and returns its midpoint (the point whose coor-
;; dinates are the average of the coordinates of the endpoints).
;; To try your procedures, youâ€™ll need a way to print points:

;; Exercise 2.3: Implement a representation for rectangles in

;; gle. Now implement a different representation for rectan-
;; gles. Can you design your system with suitable abstraction
;; barriers, so that the same perimeter and area procedures
;; will work using either representation?
