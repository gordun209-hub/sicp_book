;; Exercise 2.22: Louis Reasoner tries to rewrite the first square-
;; list procedure of Exercise 2.21 so that it evolves an itera-
;; tive process:
;; (define (square-list items)
;; (define (iter things answer)
;; (if (null? things)
;; answer
;; (iter (cdr things)
;; (cons (square (car things))
;; answer))))
;; (iter items nil))
;; Unfortunately, defining square-list this way produces the
;; answer list in the reverse order of the one desired. Why?
;; Louis then tries to fix his bug by interchanging the argu-
;; ments to cons:
;; (define (square-list items)
;; 145
;; (define (iter things answer)
;; (if (null? things)
;; answer
;; (iter (cdr things)
;; (cons answer
;; (square (car things))))))
;; (iter items nil))
;; this doesnâ€™t work either. Explain
(define (square x) (* x x))

;; The above doesn't work because it conses the last item from the
;; front of the list to the answer, then gets the next item from the
;; front, etc.
